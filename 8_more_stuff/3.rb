# Exception handling is dealing with exceptions, or errors, as they are 
# raised in programs (i.e. as they occur).
#
# This solves the problem of programs crashing when exceptions are raised
# by giving the program a way to handle exceptions and continue executing
# as opposed to crashing and not finishing.
